## Summary

<!-- One or two sentences: what this PR changes and why. -->

## Type of change

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature (CLI flag, public API surface, IR variant, …)
- [ ] Refactor (no behaviour change)
- [ ] Documentation / book / ADR
- [ ] CI / developer tooling
- [ ] Upstream comrak touch-up (requires an approving ADR — see ADR-0001)
- [ ] Bumping the pinned `aozora-*` workspace version

## Checklist

- [ ] `just ci` passes locally (lint + build + test + spec-* + coverage
      + upstream-diff + book-build).
- [ ] Added or updated tests that exercise the change.
- [ ] Updated `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` (or stated why it
      doesn't need a changelog entry).
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (lefthook enforces).
- [ ] If this touches `upstream/comrak/`: linked the approving ADR and
      confirmed `just upstream-diff` still passes (0-line diff budget,
      ADR-0001).
- [ ] If this adds a new 青空文庫 notation: filed it in the sibling
      [`P4suta/aozora`](https://github.com/P4suta/aozora) repo first
      (ADR-0010); afm-side follow-up is usually a one-line mapping in
      `afm_markdown::ir` plus a test.
- [ ] If this adds a renderer-emitted class: updated
      `afm-markdown-test-support`'s `AFM_CLASSES` and both afm-book
      themes (`afm-horizontal.css` / `afm-vertical.css`).
