//! Pre-/post-process pass that hides 青空文庫 trigger characters
//! inside CommonMark fenced code blocks.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! `aozora_pipeline` recognises every `｜` / `《` / `》` / `［` / `］` /
//! `※` / `〔` / `〕` / `「` / `」` as a candidate trigger and rewrites
//! it into a PUA sentinel before comrak ever sees the source. That is
//! exactly what we want for prose; it is exactly what we *don't* want
//! inside a fenced code block, where every byte should flow through
//! to `<pre><code>` literally.
//!
//! `aozora_pipeline` is intentionally CommonMark-blind (ADR-0010),
//! so the responsibility for teaching it about code-block context
//! lives here. The pass:
//!
//! 1. Scans the source line-by-line and tracks fenced-code-block
//!    state with the [`Phase`] machine below (CommonMark info-string
//!    fence: a run of three or more backticks or three or more
//!    tildes after at most three leading spaces, closed by a
//!    same-character run of at least the same length).
//! 2. Replaces each Aozora trigger inside a fence with [`MASK_CHAR`]
//!    (U+E000 — Private Use Area, distinct from the four sentinels
//!    U+E001..U+E004) and records the original char in source order.
//! 3. After `comrak::format_html`, restores the original chars by
//!    walking the recorded list in the same order. comrak's HTML
//!    escape only touches `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`; `MASK_CHAR` survives
//!    untouched.
//!
//! ## What's deliberately out of scope
//!
//! **Indented code blocks** (CommonMark §4.4) — `    code` — are
//! NOT masked. They start and end based on paragraph context that
//! the lexer pre-pass would need a full mini-parser to reproduce
//! (blank-line boundaries, list-item interleaving, etc.). In every
//! Aozora Bunko source we've seen, code-shaped runs use fenced
//! syntax; the pinned test
//! `tests::indent_of_four_spaces_disables_the_fence` codifies the
//! current behaviour. If a future corpus exhibits real-world
//! 4-space indented code blocks with Aozora trigger chars, this is
//! the place to extend.
//!
//! ## Why not collide with `MASK_CHAR`?
//!
//! `aozora_pipeline`'s Phase 0 already scans for source-supplied
//! PUA characters and emits a `Diagnostic::SourceContainsPua` for
//! any encountered. We pre-scan for [`MASK_CHAR`] in the *original*
//! source and skip masking entirely if any is present, returning
//! the source as a borrowed `Cow` and an empty originals list —
//! that preserves the lexer's diagnostic on the user's pristine
//! input and avoids ambiguity-of-origin in [`unmask_html`].

    //! 2. **PUA fast-path** — when the source already contains
    //!    [`MASK_CHAR`] (U+E000), masking is short-circuited to
    //!    `Cow::Borrowed` and `originals` is empty (regardless of
    //!    fence presence). The lexer's own `SourceContainsPua`
    //!    diagnostic must not be sabotaged by us mutating the bytes.
    //! 3. **Mask + unmask is identity** — for any input, replaying the
    //!    masked output through `unmask_html` with the recorded
    //!    `originals` reconstructs the source byte-for-byte. This is
    //!    the core round-trip property the masking pass exists to
    //!    provide.
    //! 4. **Outside-fence triggers are preserved verbatim** — masking
    //!    only touches the fence interior; any Aozora trigger glyph
    //!    that appears *outside* a fenced code block must survive the
    //!    pass unchanged.
